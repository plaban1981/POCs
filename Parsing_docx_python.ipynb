            "The Supreme Court has constituted a technical committee to investigate alleged use of Pegasus spyware.\n",
            "About the News\n",
            "A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court constituted a technical committee to undertake an independent investigation into the allegations that the central government used the Pegasus spyware to spy on its citizens in an unauthorised manner.\n",
            "Writ petitions alleged that the central government had misused a spyware named Pegasus produced by an Israeli technology firm, named NSO.\n",
            "Journalists, opposition leaders, a constitutional authority, businesspersons and two serving ministers in the government are some of the alleged targets of a purported surveillance operation.\n",
            "NSO Group has said that it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. \n",
            "The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients.\n",
            "The government has denied allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people and said that the Government agencies had a well-established protocol for interception.\n",
            "What is Cyber-Surveillance and related legal framework? \n",
            "Meaning: Cyber surveillance is a tool used by government for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime. \n",
            "ICT-powered surveillance tools developed and marketed by private companies are employed to monitor and track down political opponents, human rights campaigners and journalists.\n",
            "Law for Surveillance in India: The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 empowers the Central Government and State Governments of India to order the interception of messages in in the occurrence of any “public emergency” or in the interest of “public safety”.  The government can carry out surveillance under the conditions of:\n",
            "The sovereignty or integrity of India, defense of India;  Security of the State;  Friendly relations with foreign States; Public order; and preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offense relating to the above; and for the investigation of any offense.\n",
            "The Law also entails that there should be a written order for such an action and should satisfy the above conditionalities.\n",
            "What have been the questions raised by the Supreme Court against the alleged surveillance?\n",
            "The technical committee formed by the SC will need to enquire into the allegations and government’s status on it. \n",

            "What are the concerns associated with Cyber-Surveillance by the State? \n",
            "Violation of Laws: The unauthorised nature of infiltration of Pegasus spyware in devices, without the consent and knowledge of the target constitutes violation of Section 66 and Section 43 of the IT Act.\n",
            "Compromises Democracy: Information obtained illegally through cyber-surveillance can be used to compromise institutions, to steal elections, sabotage Opposition campaigns, and even dislodge an Opposition government. This is antithetical to the basic tenets of democracy.\n",
            "Privacy and free speech: Surveillance system impacts the right to privacy and the exercise of freedom of speech and personal liberty under Articles 19 and 21 of the constitution, respectively. \n",
            "No Oversight Mechanism: In the absence of parliamentary or judicial oversight, electronic surveillance gives the executive the power to influence both the subject of surveillance and all classes of individuals, resulting in a chilling effect on free speech. \n",
            "Separation of Power: Constitutional functionaries such as a sitting judge of the Supreme Court have reportedly been surveilled under Pegasus without any checks outside the executive wing of government. Vesting such disproportionate power with one wing of the government threatens the separation of powers of the government. \n",
            "Due Process of Law Violation: Such surveillance, when carried out entirely by the executive, curtails Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution (empowering the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, to issue certain writs) as it happens in secret.\n",
            "Thus, the affected person is unable to show a breach of their rights. This violates not only the ideals of due process and the separation of powers but also goes against the requirement of procedural safeguards as mandated in K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) v. Union of India (2017).\n",
            "Way Forward\n",
            "The SC committee has been asked to recommend: \n",
            "Amendments to existing laws or enactment of a new legal framework for surveillance to prevent invasion of privacy and improve the cyber security of the nation\n",
            "Establishing a mechanism for citizens to raise grievances if they suspect illegal surveillance of their devices.\n",
            "Setting up an independent agency to assess cyber security vulnerabilities and investigate cyber-attacks.\n",
            "In order to satisfy the ideal of “due process of law”, to maintain an effective separation of powers and to fulfill the requirements of procedural safeguards and natural justice, there needs to be oversight from another branch of the government. \n",
            "Only the judiciary can be competent to decide whether specific instances of surveillance are proportionate, whether less onerous alternatives are available, and to balance the necessity of the government’s objectives with the rights of the impacted individuals.\n",
            "Surveillance reform is the need of the hour in India. Not only are existing protections weak but the proposed legislation related to the personal data protection of Indian citizens fails to consider surveillance while also providing wide exemptions to government authorities. \n",
            "Conclusion: The “state and surveillance” is a far more complex equation than it may at first appear. Developments in political economy — neoliberal public-private partnerships, for example — and in new data-enabled practices of analytics, machine learning and AI all complicate relationships. This makes it hard to know what exactly transpires within the agencies — security and policing — that are early adopters of new technological and analytic styles of operation. While genuine benefits may well emerge from CSE’s new analytic method or from predictive policing, current trends indicate there is a significant trust deficit and a sense of unfairness, in both procedures and outcomes.\n",

It is due to corruption and limitations in the structural design of the Union and the state governments of India. The attention that policy differences get in legislature and political rallies is missing when it comes to debating the outcomes of policies and laws.

              "'Featured News of the Day State and Cyber-Surveillance: The SC Judgement In News The Supreme Court has constituted a technical committee to investigate alleged use of Pegasus spyware. About the News A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court constituted a technical committee to undertake an independent investigation into the allegations that the central government used the Pegasus spyware to spy on its citizens in an unauthorised manner. Writ petitions alleged that the central government had misused a spyware named Pegasus produced by an Israeli technology firm, named NSO. Journalists, opposition leaders, a constitutional authority, businesspersons and two serving ministers in the government are some of the alleged targets of a purported surveillance operation. NSO Group has said that it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work.  The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients. The government has denied allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people and said that the Government agencies had a well-established protocol for interception. What is Cyber-Surveillance and related legal framework?  Meaning: Cyber surveillance is a tool used by government for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime.  ICT-powered surveillance tools developed and marketed by private companies are employed to monitor and track down political opponents, human rights campaigners and journalists. Law for Surveillance in India: The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 empowers the Central Government and State Governments of India to order the interception of messages in in the occurrence of any “public emergency” or in the interest of “public safety”.  The government can carry out surveillance under the conditions of: The sovereignty or integrity of India, defense of India;  Security of the State;  Friendly relations with foreign States; Public order; and preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offense relating to the above; and for the investigation of any offense. The Law also entails that there should be a written order for such an action and should satisfy the above conditionalities. What have been the questions raised by the Supreme Court against the alleged surveillance? The technical committee formed by the SC will need to enquire into the allegations and government’s status on it.             What are the concerns associated with Cyber-Surveillance by the State?  Violation of Laws: The unauthorised nature of infiltration of Pegasus spyware in devices, without the consent and knowledge of the target constitutes violation of Section 66 and Section 43 of the IT Act. Compromises Democracy: Information obtained illegally through cyber-surveillance can be used to compromise institutions, to steal elections, sabotage Opposition campaigns, and even dislodge an Opposition government. This is antithetical to the basic tenets of democracy. Privacy and free speech: Surveillance system impacts the right to privacy and the exercise of freedom of speech and personal liberty under Articles 19 and 21 of the constitution, respectively.  No Oversight Mechanism: In the absence of parliamentary or judicial oversight, electronic surveillance gives the executive the power to influence both the subject of surveillance and all classes of individuals, resulting in a chilling effect on free speech.  Separation of Power: Constitutional functionaries such as a sitting judge of the Supreme Court have reportedly been surveilled under Pegasus without any checks outside the executive wing of government. Vesting such disproportionate power with one wing of the government threatens the separation of powers of the government.  Due Process of Law Violation: Such surveillance, when carried out entirely by the executive, curtails Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution (empowering the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, to issue certain writs) as it happens in secret. Thus, the affected person is unable to show a breach of their rights. This violates not only the ideals of due process and the separation of powers but also goes against the requirement of procedural safeguards as mandated in K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) v. Union of India (2017). Way Forward The SC committee has been asked to recommend:  Amendments to existing laws or enactment of a new legal framework for surveillance to prevent invasion of privacy and improve the cyber security of the nation Establishing a mechanism for citizens to raise grievances if they suspect illegal surveillance of their devices. Setting up an independent agency to assess cyber security vulnerabilities and investigate cyber-attacks. In order to satisfy the ideal of “due process of law”, to maintain an effective separation of powers and to fulfill the requirements of procedural safeguards and natural justice, there needs to be oversight from another branch of the government.  Only the judiciary can be competent to decide whether specific instances of surveillance are proportionate, whether less onerous alternatives are available, and to balance the necessity of the government’s objectives with the rights of the impacted individuals. Surveillance reform is the need of the hour in India. Not only are existing protections weak but the proposed legislation related to the personal data protection of Indian citizens fails to consider surveillance while also providing wide exemptions to government authorities.  Conclusion: The “state and surveillance” is a far more complex equation than it may at first appear. Developments in political economy — neoliberal public-private partnerships, for example — and in new data-enabled practices of analytics, machine learning and AI all complicate relationships. This makes it hard to know what exactly transpires within the agencies — security and policing — that are early adopters of new technological and analytic styles of operation. While genuine benefits may well emerge from CSE’s new analytic method or from predictive policing, current trends indicate there is a significant trust deficit and a sense of unfairness, in both procedures and outcomes.

              "'Case Study of the Day Fruit of Success Background Environment and genetic conservation is the burning agenda in the times of climate change. KR Jayan of Kerala has been working towards this after he could witness the danger of Jackfruit extinction.  Efforts that bore the fruit of success As a child Jayan’s family survived on jackfruit as a source of food and livelihood. During his profession as an auto-rickshaw driver, he could see the deterioration of the plant around the State. So, he decided to plant the saplings on his own along the roadside, or government spaces as he did not possess any property of his own. People mocked him while he was taking care of the plants and nurturing them. But soon the efforts bore the fruits of success and he went on to develop Plavu Grams, with 44 varieties in total plantation. Even the Government recognized his efforts and awarded him the Plant Genome Saviour Community Award for conserving biodiversity and reviving a wide variety of the jackfruit plant.  Quote: “Continuous effort– not strength or intelligence – is the key to unlocking our potential. -Winston Churchill   Source: Without Owning Land, Kerala Man Sets Up ‘Jackfruit Villages’ With 20,000 Trees:   Tags: UPSC, GS, Paper, Environmental conservation, Biodiversity, Perseverance, Case Study '"

              "\"Terms and Concepts Green Crackers Context: The Delhi government will not allow any firecrackers, including “green crackers”, to be sold and used in the Capital in wake of Covid-19 and the deteriorating air quality. Green crackers are eco-friendly crackers that are manufactured from alternative raw materials to leave a lesser impact on the environment and pose lesser health risks. They don't contain aluminium, barium (Barium Nitrate is responsible for heavy smoke and emissions), potassium nitrate or carbon thus causing less air pollution (30% less polluting) than the regular variety. While regular crackers emit about 160 decibels of sound, green crackers have a sound level of 110-125 decibels. For all their advantages, these eco-friendly firecrackers are more expensive than the regular ones.

Example, Relay and Strip cropping. Relay Planting: Relay planting means the planting of different crops in the same plot, one right after another, in the same season. Examples: planting rice (or wheat), cauliflower, onion, and summer gourd (or potato onion, lady’s fingers and maize), in the same season.\\xa0 It is less risky as we do not have to depend on one crop alone. It also means better distribution of labour, less insects spread, and legumes adding nitrogen to the soil. Strip cropping: Strip cropping is where wheat is grown along with corn and soyabean, in the same farm in an alternative manner. In India, where there are large fields the land is divided into strips, and strips of grass are left to grow between the crops.  Western Karnataka (and the nearby Telangana and Northern Tamil Nadu) which are the dry belts with frequent droughts, 80% of the farmers depend on strip cropping. These cropping patterns were found to increase the annual crop yield up by 15.6% to 49.9%, and decreased the environmental footprint by 17.3%, compared with traditional monoculture cropping.

MABI is a green movement aimed at systematically charting and rooting out invasive species. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines IAS as “an alien species whose introduction and spread threaten ecosystems, habitats, or species with socio-cultural, economic and environmental harm and harm to human health”. The local food chain gets afflicted with the IAS competing for space and light with native flora. It is also a large threat to livestock health as it hampers the growth of native grasses which are fodder species for herbivores and livestock. It is baneful for soil health as it is prone to faster deterioration. Cosmos sulphureus, Lantana camara etc. are some of the IAS species that cost huge sum of the farmers’ budget in eradicating them through spraying of insecticide.

The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Amendment Rules, 2021 have defined new categories of vulnerable women who are allowed termination up to 24 weeks upon meeting certain conditions and with the permission of two doctors.  These include minors, survivors of sexual assault and those with foetal malformation among others. Others may seek abortion up to 20 weeks with the permission of one doctor upon meeting certain criteria. Earlier the permission of one doctor for termination up to 12 weeks, and two doctors for 12 to 20 weeks was required.  The amended law also provides for setting up of State-level medical boards to decide if a pregnancy may be terminated after 24 weeks in cases of substantial foetal abnormalities. Globally, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, India is behind 32 countries that allow abortion on request with varying gestational limits.

              "\"Editorials of the Day Ensuring that policy outcome matches the intent- IE Essence: The article speaks about financial management system of the government highlighting the reality that a portion of government spending is lost between intent and outcome. It is due to corruption and limitations in the structural design of the Union and the state governments of India. The attention that policy differences get in legislature and political rallies is missing when it comes to debating the outcomes of policies and laws. Some of the limitations are- the final accounts for a financial year are presented to the legislature 18 to 24 months after that year’s budget is approved and archaic cash accounting followed by governments. The author states that the Tamil Nadu government has taken steps to initiative to identify and retrieve unutilised funds and identified Rs. 2,000 crore of funds have been verified as “lapsed”. They are also establishing new procedures and systems to ensure that parking of funds cannot happen outside of the finance department’s oversight and undertaking data-integrity project to identify ghost beneficiaries.  Why you should read this article? To understand about the limitation for the mismatch between the policy intent and outcomes. To know about the steps being taken by the government of Tamil Nadu to overcome some of these limitations and their five-step approach for reform and improvements.

Even though recent high level bilateral visits and attempts to forge partnerships shows signs of progress, many thorny issues like climate justice and issues in WTO remains to be ironed out. Failure to arrive at consensus by these two large democracies gives opportunity to China to dominate global affairs. Climate action and trade reforms between India and USA are mutually connected and reinforcing. Transfer of technology and trade of items that aid climate reforms like solar panels, resolution of WTO dispute would go a long way to serve the cause. Concerted action on both the climate and trade fronts is mutually beneficial and will lend additional strength to the foundation of a true partnership for the coming century.  Why should you read this article? To appreciate historic opportunity India and US have, by forging an alliance on climate and trade related issues. To understand the progress made in this direction and conflicting interests of two countries on trade and climate related issues. To understand how trade and climate issues are interconnected and related.

According to the IPCC assessment, India may face climate extremes in the near future, making it critical to maintain and strengthen its food security. Because India is predominantly dependent on the south-west monsoon and has around half its agricultural area as rainfed, the country's sensitivity to climate change is exacerbated.  To address this, we must be prepared to adapt to climate change and mitigate it through agro-ecology. The methodology is adapt to climate change, utilise natural resources responsibly, and protect biodiversity. Agro-ecology as an important policy initiative, especially in rain-fed areas could lead to a brighter future in India’s agriculture sector. Seeds must be the starting point for such interventions, and markets must be the destination.   Why should you read this article? To gain a better understanding of India's agricultural climate change susceptibility. To comprehend the importance of agro-ecology, particularly in rain-fed areas, and what efforts India should take to address the issue.

              "'Case Study of the Day Fruit of Success Background Environment and genetic conservation is the burning agenda in the times of climate change. KR Jayan of Kerala has been working towards this after he could witness the danger of Jackfruit extinction.  Efforts that bore the fruit of success As a child Jayan’s family survived on jackfruit as a source of food and livelihood. During his profession as an auto-rickshaw driver, he could see the deterioration of the plant around the State. So, he decided to plant the saplings on his own along the roadside, or government spaces as he did not possess any property of his own. People mocked him while he was taking care of the plants and nurturing them. But soon the efforts bore the fruits of success and he went on to develop Plavu Grams, with 44 varieties in total plantation. Even the Government recognized his efforts and awarded him the Plant Genome Saviour Community Award for conserving biodiversity and reviving a wide variety of the jackfruit plant.
