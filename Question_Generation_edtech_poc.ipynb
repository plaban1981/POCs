Protochlorophyllide is an intermediate in the synthesis of chlorophyll. If it is less, plants are unable to efficiently green in order to harvest sunlight and if the amount of protochlorophyllide is more, then photobleaching occurs.

              " 'Statement 1 is correct: In 2000, an amendment to Article 270 gave Constitutional sanction to the practice of keeping Union cess taxes and surcharges outside the divisible pool, a practice which was previously based only on the recommendations of Finance Commissions. With the advent of the GST in 2017, for the very first time the Union Government and State Governments have the simultaneous power to impose taxes on intra-State &lsquo;supply of goods and services. Thus, currently, revenues collected from certain sources such as income tax are necessarily part of the divisible pool while cesses and surcharges can be kept outside the divisible pool. On the other hand, revenues collected through GST are shared between the Union Government and the State Governments through mechanisms prescribed under the relevant GST legislations. <br /><br />Statement 2 is correct: The share of both cesses and surcharges have been increasing over the past few years. The increasing importance of cesses and surcharges as sources of revenue is primarily attributable to the fact that Union Government has the discretion to retain these sources of revenue and they do not compulsorily form part of the divisible pool to be shared with States. It has been seen that the Union government imposes or increases cesses and surcharges instead of taxes wherever possible and, in some cases, even replaces taxes with cesses and surcharges. Between 2014-15 and 2019-20, cesses and surcharges soared from 9.3% to 15% of the gross tax revenue of the Union government. This is why, when taxes are replaced with cesses and surcharges, as has been done as in the case of petrol and diesel, the consumer pays the same price. <br /><br />Statement 3 is incorrect: The term cess finds mention in the Constitution in two Articles. The first reference is in Article 277 and the second reference is in Article 270(1). However, the term cess is not explained. Additional Information Cess &bull;Cess is a form of tax charged/levied over and above the base tax liability of a taxpayer. A cess is usually imposed additionally when the state or the central government looks to raise funds for specific purposes. &bull; The amount collected from the Cess can be spent only for that special purpose, for which it has been recovered. If the Cess is charged for education then Govt has to spend only on education, same is the case with health or agriculture. Surcharge &bull; A surcharge is a tax on tax discussed under Article 270 and 271 of the Constitution. &bull; A surcharge is stated to be &ldquo;an increase&rdquo; in any of the duties and taxes referred to in Articles 269 and 270. &bull; Unlike a cess, in the case of a surcharge, there is no need to stipulate the purpose at the time of levy and it is the discretion of the Union to utilise the proceeds of the surcharges for whichever purpose it deems fit.',\n",

Sher Shah restored the old imperial road called the Grand Trunk Road, from the river Indus in the west to Sonargaon in Bengal. <br />o Sher Shah apparently continued the central machinery of administration which had been developed during the Sultanat period. However, we do not have much information about it. Sher Shah did not favour leaving too much authority in the hands of ministers. Sher Shah&rsquo;s excessive centralisation of authority in his hands was a source of weakness, and its harmful effects became apparent when a masterful sovereign like him ceased to sit on the throne. Hence, statement 1 is not correct. <br />o Sher Shah directed his governors and tax collectors to treat merchants and travelers well in every way, and not to harm them at all. If a merchant died, they were not to seize his goods as if they were unowned. Sher Shah enjoined upon them the dictum of Shaikh Nizami: &lsquo;If a merchant should die in your country it is perfidy to lay hands on his property.&rsquo; Sher Shah made the local village headmen (muqaddams) and zamindars responsible for any loss that a merchant suffered on the roads. If the goods were stolen, the muqaddams and the zamindars had to produce them, or point out the haunts of the thieves or highway robbers, failing which they had to undergo the punishment meant for thieves and robbers. Hence, statement 2 is correct.<br /> o Sher Shah also introduced other reforms to promote the growth of trade and commerce. In his entire empire, customs duty for goods was paid only at two places: goods produced in Bengal or imported from outside paid customs duty at the border of Bengal and Bihar at Sikrigali, and goods coming from West and Central Asia paid customs duty at the Indus. No one was allowed to levy customs at roads, ferries or towns anywhere else. The duty was paid a second time at the time of sale of goods. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.',\n",

To differentiate species that use different methods for dealing with salt, scientists categorize mangroves as either secretors&mdash;those that actively rid their tissue of salt&mdash;and non-secretors&mdash;those that block the salt from entering their tissue.<br /><br /> Statement 1 is correct: Non-Secretors-Many mangrove species survive by filtering out as much as 90 percent of the salt found in seawater as it enters their roots. They have the unique root systems, called &lsquo;aerial roots&rsquo;, providing gas transport in anaerobic sediments and supporting their trunks in soft muddy sediments. The shape of the aerial roots differs among species, such as &lsquo;prop roots&rsquo; for Rhizophora spp. and &lsquo;pneumatophores&rsquo; for Avicennia spp. These root systems also exclude salt from mangroves.<br /> <br />Statement 2 is correct: Secretors-Some species excrete salt through glands in their leaves. They push salt from the ocean water out through special pores or salt glands within their leaves. As the salty water evaporates, noticeable salt crystals often form on the surface of the leaves.<br /><br /> Statement 3 is correct: A third strategy used by some mangrove species is to concentrate salt in older leaves or bark. The leaves of some mangrove can also store unwanted salt. Since leaf cells can hold a large volume of water when compared to all other cells, salt is drawn to the leaves as a mechanism to balance the salt concentration. When the leaves drop or the bark sheds, the stored salt goes with them.<br /> <br />Statement 4 is incorrect. Non secretors completely exclude the salt from entering their vascular system. This barrier acts against osmosis, a process where water moves from areas low in salt concentration to areas high in salt concentration.',\n",

Maritime air masses form over water and are humid. Continental air masses form over land and are dry. Low wind speeds let air remain stationary long enough to take on the features of the source region, such as heat or cold.

Clean syngas can also be used to directly fire heating and drying applications such as veneer dryers, rotary dryers, lumber dry kilns, lime kilns and boilers.<br /> <br />Statement 3 is incorrect: <br />Combustion of synthesis gas, in general, produces lower emissions for heat and power generation than conventional liquid and solid fuels. The composition of the syngas strongly influences the level of emissions. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide in synthesis gases results in elevated combustion temperature that facilitates the thermal formation of NO and NO2. In contrast, higher temperatures promote complete combustion and reduce the emission of organic volatiles, which are formed mainly from minor fractions of hydrocarbons in synthesis gases. Particulate matter, metallic compounds and other undesired pollutants are usually removed before firing synthesis gases for heat and power production. Therefore, integrated gasification and combined cycle systems are more environmentally friendly than conventional power generation systems. Thus it reduces the emission level but does not eliminate them completely.',\n",

Shield Volcanoes Barring the basalt flows, the shield volcanoes are the largest of all the volcanoes on the earth. The Hawaiian volcanoes are the most famous examples. These volcanoes are mostly made up of basalt, a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted. For this reason, these volcanoes are not steep. They become explosive if somehow water gets into the vent; otherwise, they are characterised by low-explosivity. The upcoming lava moves in the form of a fountain and throws out the cone at the top of the vent and develops into cinder cone.<br /> <br />2. Composite Volcanoes These volcanoes are characterised by eruptions of cooler and more viscous lavas than basalt. These volcanoes often result in explosive eruptions. Along with lava, large quantities of pyroclastic material and ashes find their way to the ground. This material accumulates in the vicinity of the vent openings leading to formation of layers, and this makes the mounts appear as composite volcanoes.<br /> <br />3. Caldera These are the most explosive of the earth&rsquo;s volcanoes. They are usually so explosive that when they erupt they tend to collapse on themselves rather than building any tall structure. The collapsed depressions are called calderas. Their explosiveness indicates that the magma chamber supplying the lava is not only huge but is also in close vicinity.<br /> <br />4. Flood Basalt Provinces These volcanoes outpour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances. Some parts of the world are covered by thousands of sq. km of thick basalt lava flows. There can be a series of flows with some flows attaining thickness of more than 50 m. Individual flows may extend for hundreds of km. The Deccan Traps from India, presently covering most of the Maharashtra plateau, are a much larger flood basalt province.

              " 'The average salinity in the oceans and the seas is 35 PPM but it spatially and temporally varies in different oceans, seas, and lakes. The variation in salinity is both horizontal and vertical (with depth). Salinity also varies from enclosed seas through partially closed seas to open seas.<br /><br />The highest salinity is observed between 15 to 20 degree North (36 PPM) because this zone is characterised by high temperature, high evaporation but significantly low rainfall. Salinity further decreases as we move further North. Hence, statement 1 is CORRECT.<br /><br />Salinity generally, increases with depth and there is a distinct zone called the halocline, where salinity increases sharply. Other factors being constant, increasing salinity of seawater causes its density to increase. High salinity seawater, generally, sinks below the lower salinity water. This leads to stratification by salinity. Salinity at depth is very much fixed, because there is no way that water is lost or the salt is added. Hence, statement 2 is NOT CORRECT<br /> <br />Salinity varies from enclosed seas through partially closed seas to open seas. It depends upon influx of river water. Influx of river water generally decreases salinity. Example- The Mediterranean Sea in Europe has very high salinity &ndash; 38 ppt or more. It is almost closed from the main ocean, and there is more evaporation than there is rain or extra freshwater added from rivers. The Baltic Sea, almost enclosed by northern Europe and Scandinavia, has a very low salinity of about 10 ppt. This is mainly due to the huge amount of freshwater added from hundreds of rivers.

              " 'When corals experience stress from hot temperatures or pollution, they end their symbiotic relationship with the algae, typically expelling them and turning white. It is called coral bleaching. <br />Coral bleaching has a variety of causes. <br />I. Increase in seawater temperature, particularly when associated with elevated levels of solar irradiance (e.g., ultraviolet radiation). Exposure to increased temperatures and solar irradiance causes zooxanthellae to manufacture abnormally large quantities of reactive oxygen species (molecules that contain oxygen and at least one unpaired electron), which are toxic to both the algae and their coral symbionts. These changes ultimately cause a breakdown of the symbiotic relationship, characterized by the physical separation of the zooxanthellae from their coral hosts. Hence, statement 4 is correct. El Nino is the warming of ocean water in the Pacific Ocean every few years. It also leads to coral bleaching. Hence, <br />statement 1 is correct. <br />II. By changes in seawater chemistry (e.g., due to ocean acidification or pollution). Increased levels of sediment in seawater, or a coral&rsquo;s exposure to sodium cyanide (a chemical used in the capture of coral reef fish). Under such conditions the zooxanthellae may lose substantial amounts of their photosynthetic pigmentation, which decreases rates of photosynthesis and produces bleaching. Hence,<br /> statement 2 is correct <br />III. Chemicals in sunscreens and other personal care products can accumulate in areas with significant marine tourism and recreational use by humans and can promote viral infections in hard corals that lead to bleaching. Hence, <br />statement 3 is correct.<br /> IV. Many human activities release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Oceans absorb some of this gas and when it dissolves in water if forms a mild acid. Sea water is normally slightly alkaline and the increase in carbon dioxide is making it less alkaline, leading to acidification. It can interfere with the way many marine organisms produce shells or plates from calcium carbonate (CaCO3). As the oceans become more acidic (less alkaline) there is less calcium carbonate available in the water and when this happens, the calcium carbonate in marine organisms can dissolve and lead to bleaching. Hence, statement 5 is correct.',\n",

              " 'o Dumping is said to occur when the goods are exported by a country to another country at a price lower than its normal value. This is an unfair trade practice that can have a distortive effect on international trade. Anti-dumping is a measure to rectify the situation arising out of the dumping of goods and its trade distortive effect. Thus, the purpose of anti-dumping duty is to rectify the trade distortive effect of dumping and re-establish fair trade. <br />o The use of anti-dumping measures as an instrument of fair competition is permitted by the WTO. In fact, anti-dumping is an instrument for ensuring fair trade and is not a measure of protection per se for the domestic industry. It provides relief to the domestic industry against the injury caused by dumping. <br /><br />Hence, statement 1 is correct. <br /><br />o The objective of anti-dumping and allied duties is to offset the injurious effect of international price discrimination while customs duties have implications for government revenue and for the overall development of the economy. The anti-dumping duty is levied over and above the normal customs duty chargeable on the import of goods in question. <br />o Under the WTO arrangement, the National Authorities can impose duties up to the margin of dumping i.e. the difference between the normal value and the export price. The Indian law also provides that the anti-dumping duty to be recommended/levied shall not exceed the dumping margin. <br />o The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (earlier known as Directorate General of Anti-dumping and Allied Duties) was named in May 2018 as an integrated single-window agency for providing comprehensive and swift trade defence mechanism in India. <br />o DGTR now deals with Anti-dumping, counter-vailing duties (CVD), and Safeguard measures. It also provides trade defense support to our domestic industry and exporters in dealing with increasing instances of trade remedy investigations instituted against them by other countries. DGTR provides a level playing field to the domestic industry against the adverse impact of the unfair trade practices like dumping and actionable subsidies from any exporting country, by using Trade Remedial methods under the relevant framework of WTO arrangements, Customs Tariff Act &amp; Rules, and other relevant laws and international agreements, in a transparent and time-bound manner. <br /><br />Hence, statement 2 is not correct.',\n",
              " 'o Though the physical demand for gold is near zero amid the coronavirus-related nationwide lockdown, the price of gold has seen a sharp surge in recent months. <br />o The reasons for a strong rally in the gold prices: <br />\\uf0a7 The disruption in the economic activities, geopolitical uncertainties, and the global slump in economic growth has led investors away from risky assets, thus increasing the safe-haven appeal for gold. <br />\\uf0a7 Massive stimulus measures by RBI in order to support growth including an interest rate cut along with monetary stimulus measures have pumped heavy liquidity in the markets and economy. Any expansion in the paper currency tends to push up gold prices. An expansionary policy by RBI could lead to a rise in gold prices. <br /><br />Hence option 2 is not correct. <br /><br />\\uf0a7 Since gold is mostly imported commodity into India, any change in the exchange rate affects gold prices. The depreciation of the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar of around 7 per cent since last September pushed the gold prices in India even higher. <br /><br />Hence option 1 is correct. <br /><br />\\uf0a7 Gold is an efficient tool to hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. According to RBI, Gold prices also move in tandem with heightened economic policy uncertainty, thereby indicating the safe haven feature of the asset. <br /><br />Hence option 3 is correct.',\n",

As this sharing of profits remained virtually unimplemented, the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 was amended in 2009 and the concept of SMP was replaced by the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane. <br />o With the amendment of the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 the concept of Statutory Minimum Price (SMP) of sugarcane was replaced with the &lsquo;Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP)&rsquo; of sugarcane for 2009-10 and subsequent sugar seasons.

              " \"o In flexible exchange rates (also known as floating exchange rates), the exchange rate is determined by the forces of market demand and supply. If the demand for foreign exchange goes up, the domestic currency (rupee) depreciates since it has become less expensive in terms of foreign currency. By contrast, the currency appreciates when it becomes more expensive in terms of foreign currency. o Interest rate differential is important in determining exchange rate movements. <br />There are huge funds owned by banks, multinational corporations and wealthy individuals who move around the world in search of the highest interest rates. If we assume that government bonds in country A pay 8 percent rate of interest whereas equally safe bonds in country B yield 10 percent, the interest rate differential is 2 percent. <br />Investors from country A will be attracted by the high-interest rates in country B and will buy the currency of country B selling their own currency. At the same time, investors in country B will also find investing in their own country more attractive and will, therefore, demand less of country A&rsquo;s currency. This means that the demand for country A&rsquo;s currency will decrease while that of country B's currency will increase. <br />Therefore, country A's currency depreciates whereas that of country B's currency appreciates. Thus, a rise in the interest rates at home often leads to an appreciation of the domestic currency which will increase in the exchange rate of the domestic currency. <br /><br />Hence, statement 1 is correct.<br /> o If a country's imports grow faster than exports, the capital inflows from exports will not be sufficient to pay for the imports. This will lead to an increase in demand for foreign currency. Therefore the domestic currency depreciates. <br /><br />Hence statement 2 is correct.\",\n",

Their work will benefit sellers, buyers and taxpayers around the world. It will help in auctioning goods and services, such as radio frequencies, which are difficult to sell in traditional ways. <br />Wilson developed the theory for auctions of objects with a common value &mdash; a value which is uncertain beforehand but, in the end, is the same for everyone. <br />Examples include the future value of radio frequencies or the volume of minerals in a particular area. <br />Statement 2 is correct : <br />Three key variables need to be understood while designing an auction. Rules of Auction i.e. closed/sealed bids, single bids versus multiple bids. Commodity or service being put up for auction i.e. how does each bidder value an item. Uncertainty regarding which bidder has what information about the object, or even the value another bidder associates with the object. <br /><br />Additional Information: Auction theory studies how auctions are designed, what rules govern them, how bidders behave and what outcomes are achieved. The oldest form of auction is the auction of a bankrupt person&rsquo;s property to pay off his creditors. This simple design of such an auction is the highest open bidder getting the property (or the commodity in question). Over time, the format of auctions has widened to include other commodities such as spectrum for radio or telecom use, carbon dioxide emission credits, electricity or the right to collect the local garbage etc. Wilson&rsquo;s work showed why rational bidders tend to bid under their own estimate of the worth due to worries over the &ldquo;winner&rsquo;s curse&rdquo;.The winner's curse is a tendency for the winning bid in an auction to exceed the intrinsic value or true worth of an item.

(Full employment is a condition in which a person in the working age, is willing to work and also working for the specified time period as desired). The unemployment rate which is consistent with the aggregate production in the absence of various temporary frictions such as incomplete price adjustment in labour and goods markets is called natural rate of unemployment. <br />Therefore, natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment caused by supply-side factors like skill, training, knowledge etc and not the demand side factors and the natural rate of unemployment is a combination of frictional and structural unemployment that persists in an economy when labour and resource markets are in equilibrium.

Since living things react to the environmental changes, the Drabot is also designed to do so. It can skim across water and react to environmental conditions like pH, temperature or the presence of oil. It uses a self-healing hydrogel that reacts to changes in pH in a matter of seconds. When the water becomes acidic, its front and back wings fuse and this imbalance causes the robot to spin in a circle. Once the pH gets to normal level, the hydrogel un-heals itself and the fused wings get separated after which the Drabot again becomes fully responsive to environmental changes. While skimming over water, the sponges of drabot also soak up the floating oil which causes it to change its color. It&rsquo;s body is created by pouring silicon into aluminum mold and baking it. The researchers believe this kind of innovation could be a major breakthrough in providing technology solutions in the field of environment and ecology. <br />Soft robotics is the subset of robotics that focuses on technologies that more closely resemble the characteristics of living organisms.',\n",

              " 'Stars and their Lifecycle: <br />Stars are formed in clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae. Nuclear reactions (fusion- hydrogen to helium) at the centre (or core) of stars provides enough energy to make them shine brightly for many years. <br /><br />Lifetime: <br />The exact lifetime of a star depends very much on its size. Very large, massive stars burn their fuel much faster than smaller stars and may only last a few hundred thousand years. Smaller stars, however, will last for several billion years, because they burn their fuel much more slowly.<br /> <br />Phases: <br />When hydrogen fuel that powers the nuclear reactions within stars will begin to run out, they enter into the final phases of their lifetime. Over time, they will expand, cool and change colour to become red giants. The path they follow beyond that depends on the mass of the star. <br />Small stars: 1. Like the Sun, will undergo a relatively peaceful and beautiful death that sees them pass through a planetary nebula phase to become a white dwarf, which eventually cools down over time and stops glowing to become a so-called black dwarf\" which emits no energy. <br />Massive stars:1.

Asexual reproduction includes fission, budding and parthenogenesis, while sexual reproduction is achieved through the combination of reproductive cells from two individuals. <br />2. In fission, an individual splits off and forms two individuals of the same size. <br />3. Budding may lead to the production of a completely new adult that forms away from the original body or may remain attached to the original body. <br />4. Parthenogenesis refers to reproductive strategy that involves development of a female (rarely a male) gamete (sex cell) without fertilization. It occurs commonly among lower plants and invertebrate animals (particularly rotifers, aphids, ants, wasps, and bees) and rarely among higher vertebrates. <br />5. Sexual reproduction involves two individuals for the creation of a new individual. <br />6. DNA copying mechanisms creates variations which are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. Modes of sexual reproduction allow for greater variation to be generated. <br />7. Reproduction in flowering plants involves transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma which is referred to as pollination. This is followed by fertilisation. This is sexual mode of reproduction. Hence, 3 is incorrect.',\n",

              "'The earliest town in India was found in Indus valley civilisation. Harappa Mohenjodaro and Kalibangan (largest site in India) were big urban centers of that time. Before metals were discovered, humans were mostly hunter gatherers and agriculture was not well developed. A well developed agriculture is an important pre requisite to support urbanisation. The process of urbanisation in India started only after the discovery of metals. Ashta Pradhan referred to eight prominent officials of Marathas that administered Maratha Empire.<br /><br />The council was formed in 1674 by Chhatrapati Shivaji.The body discharged the functions of a modern council of ministers Megasthenes divided municipalities into 6 committees each having 5 members. The first committee was concerned with matters relating to industrial arts. The second occupied it with the facilities to the foreigners. The third kept a register of births and deaths both by way of a census and for purposes of taxation. The fourth committee was in charge of matters of trade and commerce. The fifth committee supervised the public sale of manufactured articles. The sixth commit&shy;tee collected the tax on the articles sold, this being one-tenth of the purchase price'"
