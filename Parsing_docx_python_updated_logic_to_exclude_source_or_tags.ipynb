            "The Supreme Court has constituted a technical committee to investigate alleged use of Pegasus spyware.\n",
            "About the News\n",
            "A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court constituted a technical committee to undertake an independent investigation into the allegations that the central government used the Pegasus spyware to spy on its citizens in an unauthorised manner.\n",
            "Writ petitions alleged that the central government had misused a spyware named Pegasus produced by an Israeli technology firm, named NSO.\n",
            "Journalists, opposition leaders, a constitutional authority, businesspersons and two serving ministers in the government are some of the alleged targets of a purported surveillance operation.\n",
            "NSO Group has said that it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. \n",
            "The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients.\n",
            "The government has denied allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people and said that the Government agencies had a well-established protocol for interception.\n",
            "What is Cyber-Surveillance and related legal framework? \n",
            "Meaning: Cyber surveillance is a tool used by government for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime. \n",
            "ICT-powered surveillance tools developed and marketed by private companies are employed to monitor and track down political opponents, human rights campaigners and journalists.\n",
            "Law for Surveillance in India: The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 empowers the Central Government and State Governments of India to order the interception of messages in in the occurrence of any “public emergency” or in the interest of “public safety”.  The government can carry out surveillance under the conditions of:\n",
            "The sovereignty or integrity of India, defense of India;  Security of the State;  Friendly relations with foreign States; Public order; and preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offense relating to the above; and for the investigation of any offense.\n",
            "The Law also entails that there should be a written order for such an action and should satisfy the above conditionalities.\n",
            "What have been the questions raised by the Supreme Court against the alleged surveillance?\n",
            "The technical committee formed by the SC will need to enquire into the allegations and government’s status on it. \n",

            "What are the concerns associated with Cyber-Surveillance by the State? \n",
            "Violation of Laws: The unauthorised nature of infiltration of Pegasus spyware in devices, without the consent and knowledge of the target constitutes violation of Section 66 and Section 43 of the IT Act.\n",
            "Compromises Democracy: Information obtained illegally through cyber-surveillance can be used to compromise institutions, to steal elections, sabotage Opposition campaigns, and even dislodge an Opposition government. This is antithetical to the basic tenets of democracy.\n",
            "Privacy and free speech: Surveillance system impacts the right to privacy and the exercise of freedom of speech and personal liberty under Articles 19 and 21 of the constitution, respectively. \n",
            "No Oversight Mechanism: In the absence of parliamentary or judicial oversight, electronic surveillance gives the executive the power to influence both the subject of surveillance and all classes of individuals, resulting in a chilling effect on free speech. \n",
            "Separation of Power: Constitutional functionaries such as a sitting judge of the Supreme Court have reportedly been surveilled under Pegasus without any checks outside the executive wing of government. Vesting such disproportionate power with one wing of the government threatens the separation of powers of the government. \n",
            "Due Process of Law Violation: Such surveillance, when carried out entirely by the executive, curtails Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution (empowering the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, to issue certain writs) as it happens in secret.\n",
            "Thus, the affected person is unable to show a breach of their rights. This violates not only the ideals of due process and the separation of powers but also goes against the requirement of procedural safeguards as mandated in K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) v. Union of India (2017).\n",
            "Way Forward\n",
            "The SC committee has been asked to recommend: \n",
            "Amendments to existing laws or enactment of a new legal framework for surveillance to prevent invasion of privacy and improve the cyber security of the nation\n",
            "Establishing a mechanism for citizens to raise grievances if they suspect illegal surveillance of their devices.\n",
            "Setting up an independent agency to assess cyber security vulnerabilities and investigate cyber-attacks.\n",
            "In order to satisfy the ideal of “due process of law”, to maintain an effective separation of powers and to fulfill the requirements of procedural safeguards and natural justice, there needs to be oversight from another branch of the government. \n",
            "Only the judiciary can be competent to decide whether specific instances of surveillance are proportionate, whether less onerous alternatives are available, and to balance the necessity of the government’s objectives with the rights of the impacted individuals.\n",
            "Surveillance reform is the need of the hour in India. Not only are existing protections weak but the proposed legislation related to the personal data protection of Indian citizens fails to consider surveillance while also providing wide exemptions to government authorities. \n",
            "Conclusion: The “state and surveillance” is a far more complex equation than it may at first appear. Developments in political economy — neoliberal public-private partnerships, for example — and in new data-enabled practices of analytics, machine learning and AI all complicate relationships. This makes it hard to know what exactly transpires within the agencies — security and policing — that are early adopters of new technological and analytic styles of operation. While genuine benefits may well emerge from CSE’s new analytic method or from predictive policing, current trends indicate there is a significant trust deficit and a sense of unfairness, in both procedures and outcomes.\n",

It is due to corruption and limitations in the structural design of the Union and the state governments of India. The attention that policy differences get in legislature and political rallies is missing when it comes to debating the outcomes of policies and laws. Some of the limitations are- the final accounts for a financial year are presented to the legislature 18 to 24 months after that year’s budget is approved and archaic cash accounting followed by governments.\n",

              "'State and Cyber-Surveillance: The SC Judgement In News The Supreme Court has constituted a technical committee to investigate alleged use of Pegasus spyware. About the News A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court constituted a technical committee to undertake an independent investigation into the allegations that the central government used the Pegasus spyware to spy on its citizens in an unauthorised manner. Writ petitions alleged that the central government had misused a spyware named Pegasus produced by an Israeli technology firm, named NSO. Journalists, opposition leaders, a constitutional authority, businesspersons and two serving ministers in the government are some of the alleged targets of a purported surveillance operation. NSO Group has said that it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work.  The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients. The government has denied allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people and said that the Government agencies had a well-established protocol for interception. What is Cyber-Surveillance and related legal framework?  Meaning: Cyber surveillance is a tool used by government for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime.  ICT-powered surveillance tools developed and marketed by private companies are employed to monitor and track down political opponents, human rights campaigners and journalists. Law for Surveillance in India: The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 empowers the Central Government and State Governments of India to order the interception of messages in in the occurrence of any “public emergency” or in the interest of “public safety”.  The government can carry out surveillance under the conditions of: The sovereignty or integrity of India, defense of India;  Security of the State;  Friendly relations with foreign States; Public order; and preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offense relating to the above; and for the investigation of any offense. The Law also entails that there should be a written order for such an action and should satisfy the above conditionalities. What have been the questions raised by the Supreme Court against the alleged surveillance? The technical committee formed by the SC will need to enquire into the allegations and government’s status on it.             What are the concerns associated with Cyber-Surveillance by the State?  Violation of Laws: The unauthorised nature of infiltration of Pegasus spyware in devices, without the consent and knowledge of the target constitutes violation of Section 66 and Section 43 of the IT Act. Compromises Democracy: Information obtained illegally through cyber-surveillance can be used to compromise institutions, to steal elections, sabotage Opposition campaigns, and even dislodge an Opposition government. This is antithetical to the basic tenets of democracy. Privacy and free speech: Surveillance system impacts the right to privacy and the exercise of freedom of speech and personal liberty under Articles 19 and 21 of the constitution, respectively.  No Oversight Mechanism: In the absence of parliamentary or judicial oversight, electronic surveillance gives the executive the power to influence both the subject of surveillance and all classes of individuals, resulting in a chilling effect on free speech.  Separation of Power: Constitutional functionaries such as a sitting judge of the Supreme Court have reportedly been surveilled under Pegasus without any checks outside the executive wing of government. Vesting such disproportionate power with one wing of the government threatens the separation of powers of the government.  Due Process of Law Violation: Such surveillance, when carried out entirely by the executive, curtails Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution (empowering the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, to issue certain writs) as it happens in secret. Thus, the affected person is unable to show a breach of their rights. This violates not only the ideals of due process and the separation of powers but also goes against the requirement of procedural safeguards as mandated in K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) v. Union of India (2017). Way Forward The SC committee has been asked to recommend:  Amendments to existing laws or enactment of a new legal framework for surveillance to prevent invasion of privacy and improve the cyber security of the nation Establishing a mechanism for citizens to raise grievances if they suspect illegal surveillance of their devices. Setting up an independent agency to assess cyber security vulnerabilities and investigate cyber-attacks. In order to satisfy the ideal of “due process of law”, to maintain an effective separation of powers and to fulfill the requirements of procedural safeguards and natural justice, there needs to be oversight from another branch of the government.  Only the judiciary can be competent to decide whether specific instances of surveillance are proportionate, whether less onerous alternatives are available, and to balance the necessity of the government’s objectives with the rights of the impacted individuals. Surveillance reform is the need of the hour in India. Not only are existing protections weak but the proposed legislation related to the personal data protection of Indian citizens fails to consider surveillance while also providing wide exemptions to government authorities.  Conclusion: The “state and surveillance” is a far more complex equation than it may at first appear. Developments in political economy — neoliberal public-private partnerships, for example — and in new data-enabled practices of analytics, machine learning and AI all complicate relationships. This makes it hard to know what exactly transpires within the agencies — security and policing — that are early adopters of new technological and analytic styles of operation. While genuine benefits may well emerge from CSE’s new analytic method or from predictive policing, current trends indicate there is a significant trust deficit and a sense of unfairness, in both procedures and outcomes.

              "\"Green Crackers Context: The Delhi government will not allow any firecrackers, including “green crackers”, to be sold and used in the Capital in wake of Covid-19 and the deteriorating air quality. Green crackers are eco-friendly crackers that are manufactured from alternative raw materials to leave a lesser impact on the environment and pose lesser health risks. They don't contain aluminium, barium (Barium Nitrate is responsible for heavy smoke and emissions), potassium nitrate or carbon thus causing less air pollution (30% less polluting) than the regular variety. While regular crackers emit about 160 decibels of sound, green crackers have a sound level of 110-125 decibels. For all their advantages, these eco-friendly firecrackers are more expensive than the regular ones. \""

              "'State and Cyber-Surveillance: The SC Judgement In News The Supreme Court has constituted a technical committee to investigate alleged use of Pegasus spyware. About the News A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court constituted a technical committee to undertake an independent investigation into the allegations that the central government used the Pegasus spyware to spy on its citizens in an unauthorised manner. Writ petitions alleged that the central government had misused a spyware named Pegasus produced by an Israeli technology firm, named NSO. Journalists, opposition leaders, a constitutional authority, businesspersons and two serving ministers in the government are some of the alleged targets of a purported surveillance operation. NSO Group has said that it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work.  The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients. The government has denied allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people and said that the Government agencies had a well-established protocol for interception. What is Cyber-Surveillance and related legal framework?  Meaning: Cyber surveillance is a tool used by government for intelligence gathering, prevention of crime, the protection of a process, person, group or object, or the investigation of crime.  ICT-powered surveillance tools developed and marketed by private companies are employed to monitor and track down political opponents, human rights campaigners and journalists. Law for Surveillance in India: The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 empowers the Central Government and State Governments of India to order the interception of messages in in the occurrence of any “public emergency” or in the interest of “public safety”.  The government can carry out surveillance under the conditions of: The sovereignty or integrity of India, defense of India;  Security of the State;  Friendly relations with foreign States; Public order; and preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offense relating to the above; and for the investigation of any offense. The Law also entails that there should be a written order for such an action and should satisfy the above conditionalities. What have been the questions raised by the Supreme Court against the alleged surveillance? The technical committee formed by the SC will need to enquire into the allegations and government’s status on it.             What are the concerns associated with Cyber-Surveillance by the State?  Violation of Laws: The unauthorised nature of infiltration of Pegasus spyware in devices, without the consent and knowledge of the target constitutes violation of Section 66 and Section 43 of the IT Act. Compromises Democracy: Information obtained illegally through cyber-surveillance can be used to compromise institutions, to steal elections, sabotage Opposition campaigns, and even dislodge an Opposition government. This is antithetical to the basic tenets of democracy. Privacy and free speech: Surveillance system impacts the right to privacy and the exercise of freedom of speech and personal liberty under Articles 19 and 21 of the constitution, respectively.  No Oversight Mechanism: In the absence of parliamentary or judicial oversight, electronic surveillance gives the executive the power to influence both the subject of surveillance and all classes of individuals, resulting in a chilling effect on free speech.  Separation of Power: Constitutional functionaries such as a sitting judge of the Supreme Court have reportedly been surveilled under Pegasus without any checks outside the executive wing of government. Vesting such disproportionate power with one wing of the government threatens the separation of powers of the government.  Due Process of Law Violation: Such surveillance, when carried out entirely by the executive, curtails Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution (empowering the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, to issue certain writs) as it happens in secret. Thus, the affected person is unable to show a breach of their rights. This violates not only the ideals of due process and the separation of powers but also goes against the requirement of procedural safeguards as mandated in K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) v. Union of India (2017). Way Forward The SC committee has been asked to recommend:  Amendments to existing laws or enactment of a new legal framework for surveillance to prevent invasion of privacy and improve the cyber security of the nation Establishing a mechanism for citizens to raise grievances if they suspect illegal surveillance of their devices. Setting up an independent agency to assess cyber security vulnerabilities and investigate cyber-attacks. In order to satisfy the ideal of “due process of law”, to maintain an effective separation of powers and to fulfill the requirements of procedural safeguards and natural justice, there needs to be oversight from another branch of the government.  Only the judiciary can be competent to decide whether specific instances of surveillance are proportionate, whether less onerous alternatives are available, and to balance the necessity of the government’s objectives with the rights of the impacted individuals. Surveillance reform is the need of the hour in India. Not only are existing protections weak but the proposed legislation related to the personal data protection of Indian citizens fails to consider surveillance while also providing wide exemptions to government authorities.  Conclusion: The “state and surveillance” is a far more complex equation than it may at first appear. Developments in political economy — neoliberal public-private partnerships, for example — and in new data-enabled practices of analytics, machine learning and AI all complicate relationships. This makes it hard to know what exactly transpires within the agencies — security and policing — that are early adopters of new technological and analytic styles of operation. While genuine benefits may well emerge from CSE’s new analytic method or from predictive policing, current trends indicate there is a significant trust deficit and a sense of unfairness, in both procedures and outcomes.

              "'Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Guidelines In News The RBI has revised the PCA framework for Scheduled Commercial Banks, which would come to effect from 1 Jan 2022. About the News As per the new framework, a bank will generally be placed under PCA Framework based on the Audited Annual Financial Results and the ongoing Supervisory Assessment made by RBI. Capital, Asset Quality and Leverage will be the key areas for monitoring in the revised framework. The PCA framework would apply to all banks operating in India including foreign banks operating through branches or subsidiaries based on breach of risk thresholds of identified indicators. RBI said negative return on assets (RoA) criteria for determining risk threshold removed in the revised rules. Details of the New PCA Framework Parameters: Indicators to be tracked for Capital, Asset Quality and Leverage would be CRAR/ Common Equity Tier I Ratio, Net NPA Ratio\\xa0and Tier I Leverage Ratio\\xa0respectively. Trigger points: If CRAR falls below a certain level, RBI initiates Risk Threshold 1 and asks the designated bank to submit a capital restoration plan, restrict dividend payments, etc. Similarly, if the NPA levels rise beyond a certain range or leverage falls below a certain range, RBI initiates Risk Threshold 1. For further aggravated financial conditions, Risk Threshold 2 and 3 are initiated. It could include bringing in a new management, appointing consultants for business restructuring, taking steps to change ownership/merger, impose a moratorium on the bank or credit-risk management policies to reduce loan concentration Exit provisions: The bank would be permitted to exit PCA framework if no breaches in risk thresholds in any of the parameters are observed as per four continuous quarterly financial statements. It would be based on supervisory comfort of the RBI, including an assessment on sustainability of profitability of the bank.  About the PCA The RBI’s PCA Framework was introduced in December 2002 as a structured early intervention mechanism for banks along the lines of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s PCA framework. The objective of the PCA framework is to enable supervisory intervention at appropriate time and require the supervised entity to initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner, so as to restore its financial health. The regulator imposes restrictions like curbs on lending on banks with increased vulnerability in financial ecosystem. The PCA Framework applies only to commercial banks and does not cover cooperative banks and non-banking financial companies. The restrictions enable supervisory intervention, initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner to restore bank’s financial health.
