It substituted the words ‘armed rebellion’ for ‘internal disturbance’. 2. The President however can proclaim a national emergency only after receiving a written recommendation from the cabinet. 3. The proclamation of Emergency must be approved by both the Houses of Parliament within one month from the date of its issue. Hence statement 3 is correct. 4. If approved by both the Houses of Parliament the emergency continues for six months and can be extended to an indefinite period with an approval of the Parliament for every six months. 5. Every resolution approving the proclamation of emergency or its continuance must be passed by either House of Parliament by a special majority. 6. The President must revoke a proclamation if the Lok Sabha passes a resolution disapproving its continuation. Hence statement 4 is correct. 7. If onetenth of the total number of members of the Lok Sabha give a written notice to the Speaker or to the president if the House is not in session a special sitting of the House should be held within 14 days for the purpose of considering a resolution disapproving the continuation of the proclamation.\n",

            "context : Statement 1 is correct: In 2000, an amendment to Article 270 gave Constitutional sanction to the practice of keeping Union cess taxes and surcharges outside the divisible pool, a practice which was previously based only on the recommendations of Finance Commissions. With the advent of the GST in 2017, for the very first time the Union Government and State Governments have the simultaneous power to impose taxes on intra-State &lsquo;supply of goods and services. Thus, currently, revenues collected from certain sources such as income tax are necessarily part of the divisible pool while cesses and surcharges can be kept outside the divisible pool. On the other hand, revenues collected through GST are shared between the Union Government and the State Governments through mechanisms prescribed under the relevant GST legislations. <br /><br />Statement 2 is correct: The share of both cesses and surcharges have been increasing over the past few years. The increasing importance of cesses and surcharges as sources of revenue is primarily attributable to the fact that Union Government has the discretion to retain these sources of revenue and they do not compulsorily form part of the divisible pool to be shared with States. It has been seen that the Union government imposes or increases cesses and surcharges instead of taxes wherever possible and, in some cases, even replaces taxes with cesses and surcharges. Between 2014-15 and 2019-20, cesses and surcharges soared from 9.3% to 15% of the gross tax revenue of the Union government. This is why, when taxes are replaced with cesses and surcharges, as has been done as in the case of petrol and diesel, the consumer pays the same price. <br /><br />Statement 3 is incorrect: The term cess finds mention in the Constitution in two Articles. The first reference is in Article 277 and the second reference is in Article 270(1). However, the term cess is not explained. Additional Information Cess &bull;Cess is a form of tax charged/levied over and above the base tax liability of a taxpayer. A cess is usually imposed additionally when the state or the central government looks to raise funds for specific purposes. &bull; The amount collected from the Cess can be spent only for that special purpose, for which it has been recovered. If the Cess is charged for education then Govt has to spend only on education, same is the case with health or agriculture.

According to it State includes the following  a Government and Parliament of India that is executive and legislative organs of the Union government. b Government and legislatures of states that is executive and legislative organs of state government. c All local authorities that is municipalities panchayats district boards improvement trusts etc. d All other authorities that is statutory or non statutory authorities like LIC ONGC SAIL etc. Thus State has been defined in a wider sense so as to include all its agencies. It is actions of these agencies that can be challenged in the courts as violating the Fundamental Rights. According to the Supreme Court even a private body or an agency working as an instrument of the State falls within the meaning of the 'State' undere Article 12.

However, the state demand was stated in cash. One-third of the average produce was demand of state.

The movement was in against of tinkathia system under which European planters forced peasants to cultivate indigo on 3/20 of their holding. Gandhiji went to Champaran on invitation of Rajkumar Shukla. Gandhiji&rsquo;s associate during satyagraha from Bihar were- Brij Kishore, Rajendra Prasad; Gujarat- Mahadev Desai and Narhari Parekh. Hence, statement 1 is CORRECT.<br /> &bull; Ahmedabad Mill Strike was Gandhiji&rsquo;s first hunger strike on the issue of wage increase. Gandhiji succeeded in getting 35% wage hike as demand by workers. Anusaya Behn was the person actively participated in this strike. Whereas, C.R. Das was associated with the Non-cooperation movement. He moved the resolution for main resolution of non-cooperation at the annual Congress session at Nagpur in December 1920. (he had opposed it at Calcutta session earlier as he did want Boycott of elections) Hence, statement 2 is INCORRECT. <br />&bull; Peasants of Kheda wanted remission of land revenue due to failure of crops.

The movement was in against of tinkathia system under which European planters forced peasants to cultivate indigo on 3/20 of their holding. Gandhiji went to Champaran on invitation of Rajkumar Shukla. Gandhiji’s associate during satyagraha from Bihar were- Brij Kishore, Rajendra Prasad; Gujarat- Mahadev Desai and Narhari Parekh. Hence, statement 1 is CORRECT. • Ahmedabad Mill Strike was Gandhiji’s first hunger strike on the issue of wage increase. Gandhiji succeeded in getting 35% wage hike as demand by workers. Anusaya Behn was the person actively participated in this strike. Whereas, C.R. Das was associated with the Non-cooperation movement. He moved the resolution for main resolution of non-cooperation at the annual Congress session at Nagpur in December 1920. (he had opposed it at Calcutta session earlier as he did want Boycott of elections) Hence, statement 2 is INCORRECT. • Peasants of Kheda wanted remission of land revenue due to failure of crops. Gujarat Sabha, of which Gandhiji was President, played a leading role in Kheda. Indulal Yagnik and Sardar Patel joined Gandhiji during this Satyagraha. Hence, statement 3 is CORRECT.\n",

It has seeds of nationalism and anti imperialism but the concept of common nationality and nationhood was not inherent in the revolt. • Centre Delhi Led by Bahadur shah Nominal & Bakht Khan real Reasons Sepoy’s pressure Suppressed by John Nicholson • Centre Kanpur led by Nana Saheb Reasons Did not get the pension & title Suppressed by Colin Campbell • Centre Jhansi Led by Rani Laxmi Bai Reasons Doctrine of lapse Suppressed by Hugh Rose • Centre Bihar Led by Kunwar Singh Reasons Sepoy’s pressure • Centre Bareilly Led by Khan Bahadur Khan • Centre Faizabad Led by Maulvi Ahmadullah • Centre Lucknow Led by Begum Hazrat Mahal Reasons Annexation of Awadh Suppressed by Colin Campbell    Hence Option 3 is CORRECT • By the end of 1859 British authority over India was completely reestablished.\n",

To differentiate species that use different methods for dealing with salt, scientists categorize mangroves as either secretors&mdash;those that actively rid their tissue of salt&mdash;and non-secretors&mdash;those that block the salt from entering their tissue.<br /><br /> Statement 1 is correct: Non-Secretors-Many mangrove species survive by filtering out as much as 90 percent of the salt found in seawater as it enters their roots. They have the unique root systems, called &lsquo;aerial roots&rsquo;, providing gas transport in anaerobic sediments and supporting their trunks in soft muddy sediments. The shape of the aerial roots differs among species, such as &lsquo;prop roots&rsquo; for Rhizophora spp. and &lsquo;pneumatophores&rsquo; for Avicennia spp. These root systems also exclude salt from mangroves.<br /> <br />Statement 2 is correct: Secretors-Some species excrete salt through glands in their leaves. They push salt from the ocean water out through special pores or salt glands within their leaves. As the salty water evaporates, noticeable salt crystals often form on the surface of the leaves.<br /><br /> Statement 3 is correct: A third strategy used by some mangrove species is to concentrate salt in older leaves or bark. The leaves of some mangrove can also store unwanted salt. Since leaf cells can hold a large volume of water when compared to all other cells, salt is drawn to the leaves as a mechanism to balance the salt concentration. When the leaves drop or the bark sheds, the stored salt goes with them.<br /> <br />Statement 4 is incorrect. Non secretors completely exclude the salt from entering their vascular system.

Since leaf cells can hold a large volume of water when compared to all other cells salt is drawn to the leaves as a mechanism to balance the salt concentration. When the leaves drop or the bark sheds the stored salt goes with them. Statement 4 is incorrect. Non secretors completely exclude the salt from entering their vascular system. This barrier acts against osmosis a process where water moves from areas low in salt concentration to areas high in salt concentration.\n",

Statement 2 is correct This type of climate offers some of the most extreme seasonal temperature variations found on the planet in winter temperatures can drop to below −50 °C −58 °F and in summer the temperature may exceed 26 °C 79 °F. Statement 3 is incorrect Vegetation in regions with subarctic climates is generally of low diversity as only hardy species can survive the long winters and make use of the short summers. Trees are mostly limited to conifers as few broadleaved trees are able to survive the very low temperatures in winter. This type of forest is also known as taiga\n",

These are described as follows:<br /> <br />- Rectangular Drainage: It is marked by right-angled bends and right-angled junctions between tributaries and the main stream. It differs from the trellis pattern in so far as it is more irregular and its tributary streams are neither as long, nor parallel as in trellis drainage. A rectangular drainage pattern develops on a strongly jointed rocky terrain. A typical example of this drainage pattern is found in the Vindhyan Mountains of India. Hence, pair 1 is correctly matched.<br /> <br />- Radial Pattern: The radial pattern develops when streams flow in different directions from a central peak or dome-like structure. A good example of a radial drainage pattern is provided by the rivers originating from the Amarkantak Mountain. Rivers like Narmada, Son and Mahanadi originating from Amarkantak Hills flow in different directions. This pattern is also found in the Girnar Hills(Kathiwar, Gujarat), and Mikir Hills of Assam. Hence, pair 2 is incorrectly matched.<br /> <br />- Dendritic Drainage: The dendritic pattern develops where the river channel follows the slope of the terrain. The stream with its tributaries resembles the branches of a tree, thus the name dendritic. A pattern of drainage which is branching, ramifying or dichotomizing, thereby giving the appearance ofa tree. Most of the rivers of the Indo-Gangetic Plains are of dendritic type. Hence, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.<br /><br /> - Trellis Drainage: A river joined by its tributaries, at approximately right angles, develops a trellis pattern. A trellis drainage pattern develops where hard and soft rocks exist parallel to each other. In a trellis pattern, the river forms a net-like system and the tributaries flow roughly parallel to each other. The old folded mountains of the Chotanagpur Plateau have drainage of trellis pattern.

Since living things react to the environmental changes, the Drabot is also designed to do so. It can skim across water and react to environmental conditions like pH, temperature or the presence of oil. It uses a self-healing hydrogel that reacts to changes in pH in a matter of seconds. When the water becomes acidic, its front and back wings fuse and this imbalance causes the robot to spin in a circle. Once the pH gets to normal level, the hydrogel un-heals itself and the fused wings get separated after which the Drabot again becomes fully responsive to environmental changes. While skimming over water, the sponges of drabot also soak up the floating oil which causes it to change its color. It&rsquo;s body is created by pouring silicon into aluminum mold and baking it.

These help to keep the cell clean by digesting any foreign material as well as worn out cell organelles. Foreign materials entering the cell such as bacteria or food as well as old organelles end up in the lysosomes which break complex substances into simpler substances. They are able to do this because they contain powerful digestive enzymes capable of breaking down all organic material. Hence statement 1 is CORRECT • During the disturbance in cellular metabolism or when cell gets damaged lysosomes may burst and the enzymes digest their own cell. Therefore they are also known as the ‘Suicide Bags’ of a cell. Hence statement 2 is CORRECT • Lysosomes lack DNA. They have proteins breaking down the waste. Hence statement 3 is CORRECT.\n",

Astigmatism is due to imperfect nature of eye lens. Statement 3 is correct : Hypermetropia is also called long sightedness or far sightedness. In it the near objects are not clearly visible i.e. near point is at a distance greater than 25 cm. So the image of near object is formed behind the retina. This defect is removed by using converging lens or convex lens.\n",

Mediterranean Sea is generally dry, evaporative sea and cyclonic storms don&rsquo;t grow as much. Generally, only one or two medicanes occur per year. However, recently it has been seen medicanes are likely to become a bigger problem as the planet warms due to climate change.

La Niña is sometimes referred to as the cold phase of ENSO. The ENSO cycle refers to the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east- central Equatorial Pacific. 3. In La-Nina, cooler Sea Surface Temperature is present in Eastern part of Equatorial Pacific. Hence, statement 3 is correct. 4. Along with impact on Sea Surface Temperature (SST) the La-Nina also has an impact on rainfall, temperature and wind patterns across the world. 5. Due to La-Nina, Horn of Africa could see below average rainfall and part of South-East Asia has above-average rainfall. Hence, statement 1 and 2 are correct.\n",

            "cleaned texts :Statement 1 is correct. AT1 Bonds stand for additional tier1 bonds. These are unsecured bonds which have perpetual tenure. In other words the bonds have no maturity date. Statement 2 is correct. They are issued by the Banks to meet regulatory capital requirements of 1.5% of Additional Tier 1 Capital under the BASEL III norms. Additional Information They are quite different from the normal bonds in a number of ways  Hybrid Instruments The AT1 Bonds are considered to be hybrid of shares and bonds. Just like shares there is no obligation to return the money or pay the dividend. Just like bonds the bank pay interest on such AT1 bonds.  Perpetual Bonds These Bonds do not have maturity period. Instead these bonds carry call options i.e. the banks have an option redeem them after five or 10 years. But banks are not obliged to use this call option and they can opt to pay only interest on these bonds for perpetuity. That is why they are called as Perpetual Bonds.  No Put Option Investors do not have put option i.e. the investors cannot return back the AT1 bonds to the banks. However the investors can sell these bonds in the secondary market.  Skip Interest Payments The Banks issuing the AT1 bonds can skip payment of interest for a particular year. They can also reduce the face value of the bond. However the banks can do so only when their regulatory capital ratio falls below certain threshold levels. These threshold levels are clearly specified when Banks issue AT1 bonds.  Writing down of AT1 Bonds If the RBI feels that any bank is under a financial crunch it can waive off the liability of the banks to redeem the AT1 bonds and completely write it off. The RBI has used this option in the case of Yes Bank.\n",

The scheme is designed as a Plan Scheme to be administered by the Ministry of Finance and amount in the budget are made on a yeartoyear basis. Such a grant under VGF is provided as a capital subsidy to attract the private sector players to participate in PPP projects that are otherwise financially unviable. Statement 2 is not correct. Recently The government has expanded the provision of financial support by means of viability gap funding for publicprivate partnerships PPPs in infrastructure projects to include critical social sector investments in sectors such as health education water and waste treatment. Additional information on new scheme Now under this scheme private sector projects in areas like wastewater treatment solid waste management health water supply and education could get 30% of the total project cost from the Centre. Separately pilot projects in health and education with at least 50% operational cost recovery can get as much as 40% of the total project cost from the central government. The Centre and States would together bear 80% of the capital cost of the project and 50% of operation and maintenance costs of such projects for the first five years.\n",

The scheme was launched by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in June 2020. It aims to provide micro-credit facilities to street vendors affected due to COVID-19 pandemic and will be implemented across urban, peri-urban and rural areas. The scheme will end in March 2022. Vendors will be provided with an initial working capital of up to Rs. 10000. Vendors will get an interest subsidy at 7 per cent at early or timely repayment of loans. They will have a high probability to be eligible for a higher loan if they repay the first loan on time. They do not have to provide any collateral security to access the loan. The initiative helps street vendors to resume their livelihood activities post-countrywide lockdown (due to the pandemic.). The scheme also intends to incentivize regular repayment of loans and promote digitalization by rewarding vendors who opt for digital repayments of loans.\n",

Statement 2 is correct: It is being implemented in both rural and urban areas. PM SVANidhi stands for Prime Minister Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi. The scheme was launched by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in June 2020. It aims to provide micro-credit facilities to street vendors affected due to COVID-19 pandemic and will be implemented across urban, peri-urban and rural areas. The scheme will end in March 2022. Vendors will be provided with an initial working capital of up to Rs. 10000. Vendors will get an interest subsidy at 7 per cent at early or timely repayment of loans. They will have a high probability to be eligible for a higher loan if they repay the first loan on time. They do not have to provide any collateral security to access the loan. The initiative helps street vendors to resume their livelihood activities post-countrywide lockdown (due to the pandemic.). The scheme also intends to incentivize regular repayment of loans and promote digitalization by rewarding vendors who opt for digital repayments of loans.\n",
